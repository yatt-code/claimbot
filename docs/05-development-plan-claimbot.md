# 05-Development-Plan-ClaimBot

## Project Title: Internal Claims & Overtime Management System (ClaimBot)

## 1. Development Philosophy

The development of ClaimBot will follow an agile, iterative approach, prioritizing modularity, maintainability, and scalability. We will focus on delivering core functionalities first, followed by enhancements and integrations.

*   **Iterative Development**: Break down the project into smaller, manageable sprints, allowing for continuous feedback and adaptation.
*   **Modular Design**: Ensure clear separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and database layers, promoting reusability and easier maintenance.
*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD) / Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**: Implement testing early and continuously to ensure code quality and functional correctness.
*   **Developer Ergonomics (DX)**: Prioritize clear coding standards, comprehensive documentation, and efficient development workflows to enhance developer productivity.
*   **Scalability & Performance**: Design with future growth in mind, ensuring the system can handle increased user loads and data volumes.

## 3. Technical Considerations & Best Practices

*   **API Design**: Adhere to RESTful principles, ensure clear API contracts, and consider API versioning for future changes.
*   **Data Models**: Strictly follow MongoDB schemas defined in SDS, implement robust data validation on both frontend and backend.
*   **Security**:
    *   Implement JWT for secure authentication and session management.
    *   Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) at the API level.
    *   Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Ensure secure file storage and access control for attachments.
    *   Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse.
*   **Scalability**: Design stateless backend services. Optimize database queries with appropriate indexing. Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed data.
*   **Maintainability**:
    *   Write clean, modular, and well-commented code.
    *   Maintain consistent coding standards (ESLint, Prettier).
    *   Regularly refactor and review code.
*   **Developer Experience (DX)**:
    *   Provide clear `README.md` files for project setup and running.
    *   Automate development tasks (e.g., build scripts, hot reloading).
    *   Ensure comprehensive API documentation (Swagger).

## 4. AI Integration Strategy (ClaimBot)

The AI Assistant (ClaimBot) will primarily focus on passive AI flows for auto-filling forms, with future consideration for active flows.

*   **Purpose**: To enhance user experience by intelligently extracting information from uploaded documents (e.g., receipts, timesheets) and pre-populating expense or overtime forms.
*   **Passive AI Flow (MVP)**:
    1.  **User Action**: A user uploads a receipt image or PDF document to an expense claim.
    2.  **Backend Processing**: The uploaded file is sent to a dedicated AI processing service (could be a microservice or a module within the backend).
    3.  **OCR/NLP**: This service utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to parse relevant data (e.g., date, merchant name, total amount, itemized expenses).
    4.  **Data Suggestion**: The extracted and parsed data is returned to the frontend.
    5.  **User Review**: The frontend displays the suggested data in the respective form fields, allowing the user to review, edit, and confirm before submission. This ensures user control and data accuracy.
*   **Active AI Flow (Future Extension)**:
    *   This would involve more proactive suggestions, potentially based on user calendar events, location data, or historical spending patterns.
    *   **Considerations**: Requires explicit user opt-in, robust privacy safeguards, and careful handling of sensitive personal data.
*   **Privacy & Security Tradeoffs**:
    *   **Data Minimization**: Only process data strictly necessary for auto-fill.
    *   **Anonymization/Encryption**: Sensitive data should be anonymized or encrypted during transit and at rest within the AI processing pipeline.
    *   **Access Control**: Strict RBAC for AI processing modules and their access to user data.
    *   **User Consent**: Clear mechanisms for obtaining and managing user consent for AI-driven features.
*   **Latency & Cost Tradeoffs**:
    *   **Asynchronous Processing**: AI tasks (OCR/NLP) can be computationally intensive. Implement asynchronous processing (e.g., message queues) to avoid blocking the main application thread and ensure a responsive UI.
    *   **Cost Optimization**: Choose AI models and providers based on a balance of accuracy, speed, and cost. Explore batch processing for multiple documents if applicable.
*   **AI Provider Interchangeability**:
    *   **Abstraction Layer**: Implement an abstraction layer or interface (e.g., `IAIProcessor`) that defines the expected input and output for AI services.
    *   **OpenAI API Compatibility**: Prioritize AI providers or self-hosted models that are compatible with the OpenAI API standard. This allows for easy switching between providers (e.g., OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, local LLMs via Ollama) with minimal code changes, ensuring flexibility and avoiding vendor lock-in.
    *   **Configuration-Driven**: Use environment variables or configuration files to specify the active AI provider and model, enabling dynamic switching without code redeployment.

## 5. DevOps & Deployment Strategy

*   **Containerization**: Use Docker to containerize both frontend and backend applications, ensuring consistent environments from development to production.
*   **CI/CD**: Implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines to automate:
    *   Code linting and formatting checks.
    *   Automated testing (unit, integration, E2E).
    *   Building Docker images.
    *   Deploying to staging and production environments.
*   **Cloud Platform**: Deploy to a scalable cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) leveraging services like:
    *   **Compute**: EC2, ECS, Kubernetes, or serverless functions (Lambda, Azure Functions).
    *   **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (managed service).
    *   **Storage**: S3 (for file attachments).
    *   **Networking**: VPC, Load Balancers, API Gateway.

## 6. Testing Strategy

A multi-faceted testing approach will be employed to ensure system quality.

*   **Unit Tests**: Focus on individual functions, components, and API endpoints (Jest, Supertest).
*   **Integration Tests**: Verify interactions between different modules and services (e.g., frontend-backend communication, database interactions).
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Simulate real user scenarios across the entire application (e.g., Cypress, Playwright).
*   **Performance Testing**: Assess system responsiveness and stability under various load conditions.
*   **Security Testing**: Conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
*   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Involve stakeholders to validate that the system meets business requirements.

## 7. Documentation Plan

Maintain comprehensive documentation throughout the project lifecycle.

*   **API Documentation**: Keep Swagger documentation up-to-date with all API endpoints, request/response schemas, and authentication requirements.
*   **Code Documentation**: Use JSDoc or similar for inline code comments, explaining complex logic, functions, and components.
*   **Deployment Guides**: Detailed instructions for deploying and configuring the application in various environments.
*   **User Manuals**: Guides for Staff, Managers, and Admins on how to use the system's features.
*   **Architectural Diagrams**: Maintain updated diagrams (e.g., Mermaid) for system architecture, data flows, and component interactions.
