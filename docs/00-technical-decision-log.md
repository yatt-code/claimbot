### [2025-06-05] Admin vs User-Controlled Destination Management
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Needed to balance administrative control over common destinations with user autonomy for unique travel requirements.
- **Decision**: Implemented tiered destination management system:
  - **Admin Level**: [`AdminTripTemplate`](src/models/AdminTripTemplate.ts:1) for organization-wide common routes
  - **User Level**: [`SavedTripTemplate`](src/models/SavedTripTemplate.ts:1) for personal frequently-used routes
  - **Global Templates**: Available to all users via `/admin/trip-templates` management
  - **Personal Templates**: User-specific via `/api/saved-trip-templates` endpoints
- **Consequences**:
  - **Benefits**: Standardization for common business travel, personalization for individual needs, reduced duplicate data entry
  - **Tradeoffs**: More complex template management UI, additional database collections to maintain
  - **Scalability Impact**: System can grow with organization needs while maintaining user productivity
